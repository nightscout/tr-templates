Generic, junk boiler plate
==========================

Make with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and
[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)

This is a copy of https://github.com/edsl/endefensadelsl.org, and I'm
basically just tweaking things to get it a little bit more general
before re-tweaking it for specific uses.

Plan is to use something like this to collate simple markdown
documents into a compiled suite of documents.


## Pandoc?

Pandoc allows us to maintain simple markdown prose.
Most documents are simply prose.  Often, depending on the kind of
document, a few simple rules can tweak how the document is rendered so
that it is accessible in a variety of formats: html, pdf, epub, docx,
among many others.
